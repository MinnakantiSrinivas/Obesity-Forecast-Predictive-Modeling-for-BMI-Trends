# Obesity Forecast: Predictive Modeling for BMI Trends

## **Overview**
This project focuses on predicting Body Mass Index (BMI) trends using advanced predictive modeling techniques. By analyzing factors such as family history, lifestyle choices, and dietary habits, the project identifies individuals at risk of obesity. The ultimate goal is to inform targeted interventions and promote personalized healthcare strategies.

## **Dataset**
The dataset includes variables such as:
- **Demographics**: Age, Height, Weight, Gender
- **Family History**: Overweight predisposition
- **Lifestyle Factors**:
  - Smoking, alcohol consumption
  - Dietary habits (vegetables, calorie intake)
